# StackQuest 2026

A multi-stack learning project showcasing different technologies through distinct "facets" - each one a complete, functional application built with a different stack.

## Goal

Expand knowledge beyond the comfort zone by building real applications in unfamiliar technologies.

## Facets

| Facet | Stack | Status | Repository |
|-------|-------|--------|------------|
| [Domain Hunter](https://github.com/berckan/DomainHunter) | Go + HTMX | In Progress | [berckan/DomainHunter](https://github.com/berckan/DomainHunter) |
| [Mono](https://github.com/berckan/mono) | C + SDL2 | Released (v1.9.0) | [berckan/mono](https://github.com/berckan/mono) |
| *TBD* | Next.js | Planned | - |
| *TBD* | SvelteKit | Planned | - |
| *TBD* | Solid.js | Planned | - |

## Architecture

Each facet is a **standalone repository** - fully independent, deployable, and portfolio-ready. StackQuest serves as the index/hub linking all projects together.
